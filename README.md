## My mtg server
A full-fledged Apollo Server project with React and Express.

Postgres was used as db and sequelize as ORM.

Client side: https://github.com/brunomguimaraes/my-mtg-shop

## Scripts:

After db was initialized:

`npm start`

## Author notes:

Dataloaders are practically essential for a graphql server since it may reduce the amount of requests on my db, but this is on my task list. The reason that i didn't implemented yet is due to time constraints but i understant that the code is not optimized yet.
